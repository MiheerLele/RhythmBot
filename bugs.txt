    - Switched to different version of node
    - Hasnt occured in a while

Randomly received a OggDemuxer.onStreamError when playing
    - Hasnt occurred in a long time

Sending !play messages too fast results in some songs being lost
    !play stay
    !play gnf

Will sometimes eat songs that are queued? Unsure if its related but will stop playing and not throw error message

Both the 403 and eaten songs can possibly be recovered if you had a function retry(AudioResource) that retried the request
    - Or could try storing the video instead of the resource
    - And retrying 403
    - Seem to be related to poor internet connection
