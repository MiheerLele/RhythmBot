To do related songs you could:
    Keep track of all the authors being requested
    Run a search on one of those and return a random top song from the list

Authors [21 Savage, Trippie Redd, J Cole]
On queue empty
    search for authors[random_index]
    return videos[random_song]

Will probably have to extract the playing music functionality into its own setup
    Setup connection
    Setup subscription
    Setup audioPlayer
    etc.

Remove from queue by either value or index
    var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0];
    var filtered = array.filter(function(value, index, arr){ 
        return value > 5;
    });
    //filtered => [6, 7, 8, 9]
    //array => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]
